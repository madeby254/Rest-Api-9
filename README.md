## REST API TEchdegree
In this project I've created a REST API using Express. Users administrate an imaginary school database of courses.  


### What it does
* Application lets users administrate database of courses. The user can browse, edit or even delete existing courses and add new ones. The user needs to be logged in to make changes or sign up. If no account is created you can only see existing courses


## How to start it

Run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```

Second, seed the SQLite database.

```
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```
npm start
```

## Testing
To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).<br>

To test and explore application use [Postman](https://www.postman.com) a popular application for testing REST APIs.
